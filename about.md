The Statistical Genetics Lab is hosted by Department of Genetics,
Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture, University of SÃ£o Paulo.

The Lab has a group of people (faculty, postdocs, graduated students
and undergrads) that has a common interested: develop methods to
analyze genetic data. There are a number of subjects being
investigated, including major crops and also less studied species.
Polyploids are also investigated and having being the major focus of
the Lab from some years.

Collaboration is high valued. Everybody is supposed to present ideas
and share scientific discoveries, and also to disseminate the ideas of
free software, collaborative tools, and reproducible research.

Students with more experience normally help the new ones, encouraging
them to follow the good steps and developing a strong sense of
self-learning, responsibility, and collaboration.

New students joining the group need to learn a number of new tools
that normally are not presented on regular courses. This web page has
a special section presenting short tutorials about these tools.

Every week, there are Lab meetings, when everybody must present their
progress on specific research topics. Also, there are "tematic" weekly
meetings. Nowadays, the subject is "mixed models": the group is
reading and discussing a book altogether.

## Some research topics:

* Genetic mapping: statistical methods and the software
  [_OneMap_](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/onemap/index.html)
* QTL Mapping
* Association Mapping
* G x E interaction
* Genomic Selection
* Genetic of Polyploids
