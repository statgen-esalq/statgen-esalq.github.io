Here we list the softwares developed and under development by the Statiscal-Genetics Laboratory and partners.

#### OneMap 
Software for constructing genetic maps in experimental crosses: full-sib, RILs, F2 and backcrosses.
To install, we recommend the under development (and constantly upgraded) version from github:
- [www.github.com/augusto-garcia/onemap](www.github.com/augusto-garcia/onemap)

Otherwise, you can install the stable version:

- [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/onemap/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/onemap/index.html)

#### SuperMASSA
It is a graphical Bayesian inference tool for genotyping polyploid compatible with any quantitative genotyping methods. It was mainly developed by Oliver Serang as visiting scientist in the Lab. A suitable pipeline adapted for many markers will be released soon. It can be found at:

- [http://statgen.esalq.usp.br/SuperMASSA/](http://statgen.esalq.usp.br/SuperMASSA/)

#### AGHMatrix
It is an R package to compute relationship matrices for diploid and autopolyploid species. It handles pedigree and molecular data with dosage. It has been developed in collaboration with [Bluberry Breeding & Genomic Lab](http://www.blueberrybreeding.com/) at University of Florida. It can be found at:

- [https://github.com/prmunoz/AGHmatrix](https://github.com/prmunoz/AGHmatrix)

#### fullsibQTL
Software for QTL mapping in outcrossing species using composite interval mapping. It is under development and will be released soon. Based on [Gazaffi et. al 2014](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11295-013-0664-2).
