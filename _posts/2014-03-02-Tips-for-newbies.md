### Welcome!

Thanks for reading this post[^1]. We have some tips in order to help
you to join the group and understand how we work and what we are
doing.

First of all, it is important that you understand that you will need
to learn a number of things about (surprise!) genetics and also
statistics.

This will be mostly covered on the courses you will take, papers you
will read, and meeting you will have you your advisor and with other
students.

Other than that, you will need to learn a number of things related on
how to use this new knowledge for doing your research. This is what
this post is about: presenting you to computing tools that you will
not learn on regular courses.

All statistical geneticists must have at least some basic knowledge on
all topics below. The good news is that they are extremely useful and
will help you for the rest of your career. Even better, we are here to
help! That's what our Lab is about.

* Linux
* Writing computer programs
* R
* git
* github
* Emacs
* LaTeX

Don't feel intimidated with this list! There are a number of good
tutorials that we will recommend. We also have our own texts. In the
future, you can share your experience by improving the tutorials you
read.

All of these topics will have a post on the Lab's website. Go there
and start learning!
