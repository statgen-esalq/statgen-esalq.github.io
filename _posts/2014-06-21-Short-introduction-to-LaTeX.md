### LaTeX

Thanks for reading this post[^1].

LaTeX is a very important software that we use in the Lab for
producing almost all of our documents. This includes reports,
articles, projects, thesis, slides, posters, and even visitor cards.
So, it is something that you **must learn**.

How to start? I don't need to write a tutorial, since you can find
very good ones on the internet. My personal preference is the Wikibook
about LaTeX that you can find at
[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX)

Don't be lazy, go ahead and read it. There is a pdf version for
printing and online reading. Although it has a steep learning curve,
it is something that is so useful that every minute you will expend on
learning it will certainly pay back.

But before start reading the book, please install LaTeX with all files
and options. Go to your Linux terminal and type

```
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```

It will take sometime, but everything will be installed and ready to
use. 

It is not a coincidence that I chose this title for the post. There is
very famous LaTeX tutorial named
[The not so Short Introduction to LaTeX](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/).
You could also decide to read it.

If you still think that other text editors are better than LaTeX, that
is too complicated, read
[The Beauty of LaTeX](http://nitens.org/taraborelli/latex).

Good luck! Remember, we are here to help, but do your homework first.
