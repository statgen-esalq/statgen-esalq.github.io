#### Antonio Augusto Franco Garcia

_**Augusto**_ is the Faculty responsible for the Lab.
He is also responsible for maintaining this web page. His professional
web page is
[http://augusto-garcia.github.io/](http://augusto-garcia.github.io/).

Augusto's research goals include having a better understanding of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits, through linkage and QTL mapping, association mapping, and genomic selection. Most of his activities involve sugarcane, a complex autopolyploid species that does not fully benefit from molecular markers technology, but many other plant species have also been studied.

He is also an enthusiastic of free software, and has been using Linux for many years. He strongly supports and encourage the usage of R,
Emacs, LaTeX, and git, among many other software and tools.

## Postdocs

#### Kaio Olímpio das Graças Dias (by himself)

_**Kaio**_ has an undergraduate degree in Agronomy (2010) and Master degree (2013) and PhD (2016) in Genetics and Plant Breeding at Federal University of Lavras (UFLA). <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Kaio.jpg" height="100">{: .image-pull-right}

In 2010, he was at University of Minnesota as a trainee. As PhD candidate, he was a visitor Scholar at University of Florida in 2015, working in a statistical-genetics model for genotype-by-environment interaction for genome wide selection analysis. He has experience in plant breeding, quantitative genetics, linear mixed models and genome wide selection. His currently work is about quantitative genetics, linear mixed model and bayesian approach applied to plant breeding. For more information about Kaio, please visit his [Lattes CV](http://lattes.cnpq.br/7079781475856604).

#### Letícia Aparecida de Castro Lara (by herself)

_**Letícia**_ has a PhD at Department of Genetics of the University of São Paulo (ESALQ/USP). <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Leticia.jpg" height="120">{: .image-pull-right}

She has an undergraduate degree in Biology and Master degree in Genetics and Plant Breeding at Federal University of Lavras (UFLA). During her undergraduate and master, she worked with molecular genetics focusing on identification of QTL for disease resistance in common bean. In her PhD, she worked with development of statistical models in genomic selection considering allelic dosage for autotetraploid species, with applications in Panicum maximum. In her internship, she was supervised by Professor Zhao-Bang Zeng at North Carolina State University (NCSU, USA) where she compared the accuracy of prediction models using diploid dosage and tetraploid dosage. She has concentrated her studies in Quantitative Genetics of polyploids, Computing for Statistical Genetics (especially in R software) and Mixed Models.
