He is also responsible for maintaining this web page. His professional
web page is
[http://augusto-garcia.github.io/](http://augusto-garcia.github.io/).

Augusto's research goals include having a better understanding of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits, through linkage and QTL mapping, association mapping, and genomic selection. Most of his activities involve sugarcane, a complex autopolyploid species that does not fully benefit from molecular markers technology, but many other plant species have also been studied.

He is also an enthusiastic of free software, and has been using Linux for many years. He strongly supports and encourage the usage of R,
Emacs, LaTeX, and git, among many other software and tools.
